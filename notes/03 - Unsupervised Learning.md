# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with `little or no idea` what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

# Question

Of the following examples, which would you address using an unsupervised learning algorithm?  (Check all that apply.)

- Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.
  - No, this should be a Supervised Learning problem.

- Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories.
  - Yes, this should be a Supervised Learning problem.

- Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.
  - Yes.

- Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not.
  - No, this should be a Supervised Learning problem as we need to tell computer the correct answer.
